# Credits

**Credit where it is due — no negotiations.** This toolkit stands on the
work of the people and communities below. Nothing here was copied from
them: every technique is re-derived in this repo's own words and code, and
this file plus in-file credit lines say plainly where the ideas came from.
(One deliberate exception: the MIT-licensed design-intelligence search
tooling is vendored under `design/intelligence/` — see its entry below.)
If you fork or share this repository, these credits travel with it. If you
adopt a new idea into it, add its source here in the same change
(see `.claude/rules/attribution.md` — this is a hard rule, not a courtesy).

## Skill repositories whose ideas were adopted

Same rule as everywhere else: nothing copied — each idea is re-expressed in
our own words, with an in-file credit line where it lands. The commit pins
the exact revision consulted (repos were read via forks under
`github.com/DogodaBjorn`; licenses and copyrights are the upstream authors').

| **hp-world-champs** (`E:\PowerBI Set-up\hp-world-champs`, design_handoff_powerbi bundle) | Playwright layout-extraction and reference-capture tools (`tools/extract_layout.mjs`, `tools/capture_references.mjs`), generalized (LEGO/HP specifics stripped, defaults parameterized, 1280×720 canvas and @2x capture kept); the pixel-perfect skill's golden rules, workflow, and ±2px definition of done; minimal PBIR template shapes (incl. the `"13px"`-string fontSize quirk); the `playwright 1.61.1` pin. | MIT (repo LICENSE, © 2026 Bjorn / dogoda.nl — own prior client work) · `dddbc82db28f047e55cc0ad205d07bd553f7b1b6` | `scripts/prototype/`, px-prototype module (`.claude/skills/px-prototype/`) |
| **LinkedInContentOps** (`E:\TrainerBjornOps\LinkedInContentOps`, private) | The anchor-conditioned Gemini image renderer (rewritten from the `@google/genai` SDK to a zero-dependency fetch against the generateContent REST endpoint); the image-profile pattern (style_spec + palette + negatives + style anchors + default sizes) as `imagery-profile.yaml` with hexes replaced by brand-role references; the config/secrets resolution pattern with graceful no-key degradation. | First-party, no LICENSE file — adopted by ownership (bjorn@dogoda.nl), not under a license grant · `3a8ccd9bb97b38f03e7b5d1fa2341ee74623f5db` | `scripts/imagery/render_image.mjs`, `design/brand-kits/_template/imagery-profile.yaml`, imagery-studio module |
| **TrainerBjornOps** (`E:\TrainerBjornOps`, private — `figma-infographic-design` skill) | The Figma working discipline: content-first (contracts are the source of truth, never invent numbers in Figma), mechanism-mapping before any API call, one element per `use_figma` call with a screenshot check after each, explorations on their own never-overwritten pages, feedback captured as dated rules, and explorations never touching pipeline state. | First-party, no LICENSE file — adopted by ownership (bjorn@dogoda.nl) · `3a8ccd9bb97b38f03e7b5d1fa2341ee74623f5db` | fg-figma module (`.claude/skills/fg-figma/`) |
